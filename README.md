Copper Industry Pricing & Lead Classification Tool
Project Overview
The Copper Industry Pricing & Lead Classification Tool is an advanced machine learning application designed for the copper industry. This tool provides dual functionality:

Copper Price Prediction: Predicts future copper prices using a Random Forest Regression model with 96% accuracy.
Lead Classification: Classifies potential business leads using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification model with 99% accuracy.
These capabilities assist industry stakeholders in making data-driven decisions, optimizing pricing strategies, and prioritizing valuable business leads.

Features
Price Prediction:

Model: Random Forest Regression
Accuracy: 96%
Description: Predicts future copper prices based on historical data, market trends, production costs, and global demand.
Lead Classification:

Model: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification
Accuracy: 99%
Description: Classifies leads into categories based on client profiles, purchasing history, and market segments to identify high-value opportunities.

Usage
Training the Models
Train the Random Forest Regression Model

bash
Copy code
python scripts/train_price_model.py
This script trains the model using historical pricing data and saves the trained model in the models/ directory.

Train the KNN Classification Model

bash
Copy code
python scripts/train_lead_model.py
This script trains the model using lead data and saves the trained model in the models/ directory.

Making Predictions
Predict Copper Prices

bash
Copy code
python scripts/predict_price.py --input data/input_price.csv --output results/predicted_prices.csv
This script uses the trained Random Forest model to predict copper prices from the input CSV file and saves the predictions in results/.

Classify Leads

bash
Copy code
python scripts/classify_leads.py --input data/input_leads.csv --output results/classified_leads.csv
This script uses the trained KNN model to classify leads from the input CSV file and saves the results in results/.
